# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

## Your Breakdown Here

Ticket #1 - SQL - Update
Update Facilities table to include a customer Id that is a 1:1 relation with the internal auto incremented Id

As part of the ticket, will need to include the following:

Script to Update the Facilities table to include a Custom Id
Script to backfill the existing Facilities table to ensure the new Custom Id is filled.  (We can default the valut to be the auto incremented Id)

Questions:
- Is there any limitation on the custom ids such as length, alpha numeric?
- Are there any security implementation in place (Do we need to ensure the value is encrypted?)

Based on the answer to the questions above the requirement could be updated to reflect the changes



Ticket #2 - API - Update
Create an Internal PUT API end point to allow for customization of the Facilities which will intially only include the ability to update the internal customer id of a facility.

HTTP Response code
200 - Update as successful
400 - Missing required information
400 W Status Code - if validation failed


Ticket #3 - API - getShiftsByFacilityCustomId
Create an Internal Get API end piont to be able to generate the same meta data generated by getShiftsByFacility using the new custom id generated

Ticket #4
It wasn't clear from the requirement how generateReport is getting called.  
If generateReport is calling getShiftsByFacility internally, then we will need to either create a new generateReport function that calls getShiftsByFacilityCustomId or update  generateReport to call getShiftsByFacilityCustomId

If generateReport is mostly parsing the data that is being returned by getShiftsByFacility, then we will need to just update the internal call to getShiftsByFacilityCustomId
